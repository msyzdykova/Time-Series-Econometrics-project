# Time-Series-Econometrics-project
This project focuses on forecasting the monthly supply of new houses in the United States over a 12-month horizon. Using data from FRED spanning 1971–2025, we applied a sequence of time series models—AR, ARMA, ADL, and finally ADL combined with GARCH—to capture trends, autocorrelation, and volatility in the data.
